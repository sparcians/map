# Tree node extensions: Three ski trails from Mont Tremblant, Québec.
# The "ski_trail" extension has a registered factory in the test file.

# This YAML file will specify extensions ahead of time on:
#   - top
#   - top.node1
#   - top.node1.node2
#
# The test also has:
#   - top.node1.node2.node3
#
# And we will dynamically add extensions to node3 only when we call
# TreeNode::getExtension() on that node in the test.
