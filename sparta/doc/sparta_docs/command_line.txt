  \page common_cmdline Command Command Line Interface
  Sparta provides a number of application-frontend classes in the sparta::app namespace. The essential
  goal of these classes is to make the creation of a sparta-based simulation quick, simple, and
  consistent.

  \section cmdline_sim CommandLineSimulator
  sparta::app::CommandLineSimulator provides a command-line parser and help-text generator based on
  boost::program_options. This interface contains dozens of options common to all sparta-based simulations and
  allows simulator-specific options to be added from outside of sparta as needed.

  Among all features provided by this class (in conjunction with sparta::app::Simulation, the most
  useful are command-line-based logging configuration and simulator parameter-setting (configuration).

  \subsection cmdline_log_cfg Logging Configuration
  Logging output configured through the classes in the sparta::app namespace apply as the simulator
  starting up, while running, and when tearing down.

  <br/>To log all warning messages from the entire device tree (top or below) to stdout (1).<br />
  \verbatim
  $ ./sim -l top warning 1
  \endverbatim

  <br/>To log all warning messages from core0 and core1 to newly-created file "cores.log"<br/>
  <i>Note that this assumes nodes called core0 and core1 as children of the 'top' root node</i>.<br />
  \verbatim
  $ ./sim -l top.core0 warning cores.log -l top.core1 warning cores.log
  \endverbatim

  <br/>To log all messages of <b>any category</b> from core0 to stdout (1) and all warnings from the entire
  simulated tree to stderr (2)<br/>
  <i>Note that this assumes nodes called core0 and core1 as children of the 'top' root node</i>.<br />
  \verbatim
  $ ./sim -l top.core0 "" cores.log -l top warning 2
  \endverbatim

  <br/>Note that the logging system is smart about routing multiple overlapping trees to the same output
  such that any message can only be written to a particular file exactly once. In this example,
  the warnings from the entire simulated tree will be written to cores.log and all messages from core1
  (which includes warnings) will be written to cores.log. However, each warning message from core1
  will be seen exactly 1 time in cores.log<br/>
  <i>Note that this assumes nodes called core0 and core1 as children of the 'top' root node</i>.<br />
  \verbatim
  $ ./sim -l top warning cores.log -l top.core1 "" cores.log
  \endverbatim

  \subsection cmdline_sim_cfg Command Line Simulation Configuration
  \verbatim
  $ ./sim -c myconfiguration.yaml
  \endverbatim

  \section example_cmdline_help_out Example Output
  The following is example output from CommandLineSimulator when the --help option has been
  set. This was generated from a sparta-based model on Jan 10, 2013.
  \verbatim
  General Options:
  -h [ --help ]                         show this help message

  simulator to stderr. Unset by default
  --show-tree                           Show the device tree during all stages
  of construction excluding hidden nodes.
  This also enables printing of the tree
  when an exception is printed

  finalization. Shown in a separate tree
  printout from all other --show-*
  parameters
  --show-counters                       Show the device tree Counters,
  Statistics, and other instrumentation
  after finalization. Shown in a separate
  tree printout from all other --show-*
  parameters
  --show-notifications                  Show the device tree notifications
  after finalization excluding hidden

  Shown in a separate tree printout
  from all other --show-* parameters
  --show-dag                            Show the dag tree just prior to running
  simulation
  --write-final-config FILENAME         Write the final configuration of the
  device tree to the specified file
  before running the simulation
  --write-final-config-verbose FILENAME Write the final configuration of the
  device tree to the specified file
  before running the simulation. The
  output will include parameter
  descriptions and extra whitespace for
  readability
  -p [ --parameter ] PATTERN VAL        Specify an individual parameter value.
  Multiple parameters can be identified
  using '*' and '?' glob-like wildcards.
  Example: --parameter
  top.core0.params.foo value
  -c [ --config-file ] FILENAME         Specify a YAML config file to load at
  the top of the simulator device tree.
  Example: "--config-file config.yaml"
  This is effectively the same as
  --node-config-file top params.yaml
  -n [ --node-config-file ] PATTERN FILENAME
  Specify a YAML config file to load at a
  specific node (or nodes using '*' and
  '?' glob-like wildcards) in the device
  tree.
  Example: "--node-config-file top.core0
  core0_params.yaml"
  -z [ --pipeline-collection ] OUTPUTPATH
  Run pipeline collection on this
  simulation, and dump the output files
  to OUTPUTPATH. OUTPUTPATH can be a
  prefix such as myfiles_ for the
  pipeline files and may be a directory
  Example: "--pipeline-collection
  data/test1_"
  Note: Any directories in this path must
  already exist.

  --heartbeat HEARTBEAT                 The interval in ticks at which index
  pointers will be written to file during
  pipeline collection. The heartbeat also
  represents the longest life duration of
  lingering transactions. Transactions
  with a life span longer than the
  heartbeat will be finalized and then
  restarted with a new start time. Must
  be a multiple of 100 for efficient
  reading by Argos. Large values will
  reduce responsiveness of Argos when
  jumping to different areas of the file
  and loading.
  Default = 5000 ticks.

  -l [ --log ] PATTERN CATEGORY DEST    Specify a node in the simulator device
  tree at the node described by PATTERN
  (or nodes using '*' and '?' glob
  wildcards) on which to place place a
  log-message tap (observer) that watches
  for messages having the category
  CATEGORY. Matching messages from those
  node's subtree are written to the
  filename in DEST. DEST may also be '1'
  to refer to stdout and '2' to refer to
  cerr. Any number of taps can be added
  anywhere in the device tree. An error
  is generated if PATTERN does not refer
  to a 1 or more nodes. Use --help for
  more details
  Example: "--log top.core0 warning
  core0_warnings.log"
  --report PATTERN DEF_FILE DEST [FORMAT]
  Specify a node in the simulator device
  tree at the node described by PATTERN
  (or nodes using '*' and '?' glob
  wildcards) at which generate a
  statistical report that examines the
  set of statistics based on the Report
  definition file DEF_FILE. At the end of
  simulation, the content of this report
  (or reports, if PATTERN refers to
  multiple nodes) is written to the file
  specified by DEST. DEST may also be  to
  refer to stdout and 2 to refer to
  stderr. Any number of reports can be
  added anywhere in the device tree.An
  error is generated rror generated if
  PATTERN does not refer to 1 or more
  nodes. FORMAT can be used to specify
  the format. See the report options
  section with --help for more
  details about formats.
  Example: "--report top.core0
  core_stats.yaml core_stats txt"
  Example: "--report top.core*
  core_stats.yaml core_stats.%l"
  Example: "--report top.core*
  core_stats.yaml core_stats"
  --report-all DEST [FORMAT]            Generates a single report on the global
  simulation tree containing all counters
  and statistics below it. This report is
  written to the file specified by DEST
  using the format specified by FORMAT
  (if supplied). Otherwise, the format is
  inferred from DEST. DEST may be a
  filename or 1 to refer to stdout and 2
  to refer to stderr. See the report
  options setcion with --help for
  more details.This option can be used
  multiple times and does not interfere
  with --report.
  Example: "--report-all core_stats.txt"
  Example: "--report-all output_file
  html"
  Example: "--report-all 1"
  Attaches a single report containing
  everything below the global simulation
  tree and writes the output to
  destination
  --debug-on DEBUG_ON_TICK
  Delay the recording of useful
  information starting until a specified
  simulator tick. This includes any
  user-configured pipeline collecion or
  logging (builtin logging of warnings to
  stderr is always enabled). Note that
  this is just a delay, logging and
  pipeline collection must be explicitly
  enabled.
  WARNING: The DEBUG_ON_TICK may only be
  partly included. It is dependent upon
  when the scheduler fires. It is
  recommended to schedule a few ticks
  before your desired area.
  Example: --debug-on 5002
  --pipeline-collection PREFIX_ --log top
  debug 1
  begins pipeline collection to PREFIX_
  and logging to stdout at some point
  within tick 5002 and will include all
  of tick 5003

  Application-Specific Options:
  --version                        produce version message
  -i [ --instruction-limit ] LIMIT Limit the simulation to retiring a specific
  number of instructions. 0 (default) means no
  limit. If -r is also specified, the first
  limit reached ends the simulation
  --add-trace TRACEFILE            Specifies a tracefile to run

  Advanced Options:
  --show-hidden         Show hidden nodes in the tree printout (--show-tree).
  Implicitly turns on --show-tree
  --verbose-config      Display verbose messages when parsing any files (e.g.
  parameters, report definitions,  etc.). This is not a
  generic verbose simulation option.
  --show-options        Show the options parsed from the command line
  --debug-sim           Turns on simulator-framework debugging output. This is
  unrelated to general debug logging

  Logging:

  The "--log" DEST parameter can be "1" to refer to stdout, "2" to refer to
  stderr, or a filename which can contain any extension shown below for a
  particular type of formatting:

  ".log.basic" -> basic formatter. Contains message origin, category, and
  content
  ".log.verbose" -> verbose formatter. Contains all message meta-data
  ".log.raw" -> verbose formatter. Contains no message meta-data
  (default) -> Moderate information formatting. Contains most message meta-data
  excluding thread and message sequence.

  Note that parameters and configuration files specified by the -c (global
  config file), -n (node config file), and -p (parameter value) options are
  applied in the left-to-right order on the command line, overwriting any previous
  values.

  Reports:

  The "--report" PATTERN parameter can refer to any number of nodes in the
  device tree. For each node referenced, a new Report will be created and
  appended to the file specified by DEST for that report. If these reports
  should be written to different files, variables can be used in the destination
  filename to differentiate:
  %l => Location in device tree of report instantiation
  %i => Index of report instantiation
  %p => Host process ID
  %t => Timestamp
  %s => Simulator name

  Additionaly, the DEST parameter can be a filename or "1", referring to stdout,
  or "2", referring to stderr

  The optional report FORMAT parameter must be omitted or "txt" in this version.
  Only plaintext output is supported
