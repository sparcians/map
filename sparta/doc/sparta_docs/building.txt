  See <a href="https://github.com/sparcians/map/blob/master/sparta/README.md">README.md</a> on GitHub for instructions on building.

  Notes on what's built...

  Building sparta produces two main libraries:
  - \c libsparta.a containing the core sparta code
  - \c libsimdb.a  containing functionality to generate reports with SQLite3

  \subsection includes Sparta Header Files

  All sparta header files can be found within the \c sparta directory of
  the sparta project. All SimDB files can be found in the \c          simdb
  directory of the sparta project.  At minimum, the following include
  paths must be added to your project:

  \code
  # Where SPARTA_BASE=/path/to/map/sparta

  # Standard make
  -isystem $(SPARTA_BASE) -isystem $(SPARTA_BASE)/simdb/include

  # Using CMake
  include_directories (SYSTEM ${SPARTA_BASE})
  include_directories (SYSTEM ${SPARTA_BASE}/simdb/include)

  \endcode

  \subsection linking Sparta Libraries

  The Sparta project uses CMake.  If your project uses CMake as well,
  simply include the cmake config file and add \c Sparta_LIBS to your \c
  target_link_libraries call:

  \code
  include (${SPARTA_BASE}/cmake/sparta-config.cmake)
  target_link_libraries(mysim ${Sparta_LIBS})
  \endcode

  For other build systems, the following libraries are required to link
  against Sparta.  Note that this list may be out of date.  Please look
  in \c sparta-config.cmake for the latest list of libraries.

  \code

  sparta
  simdb
  hdf5
  sqlite3
  yaml-cpp
  z
  pthread
  Boost::date_time
  Boost::iostreams
  Boost::serialization
  Boost::timer
  Boost::program_options

  \endcode
