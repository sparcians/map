  \page building Building and Integrating the Framework
  See <a href="https://github.com/sparcians/map/blob/master/sparta/README.md">README.md</a> on GitHub for instructions on building.

  Notes on what's built...

  Building sparta produces two main libraries:
  - \c libsparta.a containing the core sparta code
  - \c libsimdb.a  containing functionality to generate reports with SQLite3

  \subsection cmake CMake Support

  If Sparta was installed properly in a conda environment or natively
  on the host machine, \c cmake can find Sparta and include it
  automatically in any project using the packaging system:

  \code
  find_package(Sparta REQUIRED)

  # Might be necessary if Sparta was NOT installed in standard place:
  include_directories (SYSTEM ${SPARTA_INCLUDE_DIRS})
  \endcode

  \subsection includes Sparta Header Files

  All sparta header files can be found within the \c sparta
  directory. All SimDB files can be found in the \c simdb directory
  installed alongside the Sparta libraries.
