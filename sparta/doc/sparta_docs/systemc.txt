  The Sparta Scheduler can work in a SystemC environment using the
  sparta::SysCSpartaSchedulerAdapter.

  \section building_sysc Building

  There is no requirement to build Sparta any differently to enable
  SystemC in Sparta.  However, to run the testing (and examples, once
  available), make sure the Sparta CMake build environment can find
  the SystemC package during configuration.  A message in the
  configuration output will be written if the package was found:

  \code
  % cd sparta/build; cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  ...
  -- SystemC enabled: 2.3.3.20181013
  ...
  \endcode

  If not, then `cmake` could not find the SystemC package.  This can
  happen if there exists an install of SystemC elsewhere on the system
  (like a user's home directory).  Sparta can still use that install,
  but it must be built with the same C++ standard.  How to do that:

  \code
  cd /path/to/systemc-2.3.3; mkdir build; cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  make install
  \endcode

  Then, configure/build Sparta again:

  -# Set your `SYSTEMC_HOME` environment variable to the SystemC build:
  `export SYSTEMC_HOME=/path/to/systemc-2.3.3`
  -# Re-configure Sparta: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`

  The enablement message should print at this point.

  \section sysc_adapter SystemC/Sparta Adapter

  The sparta::SysCSpartaSchedulerAdapter is just that, and adapter
  that syncs the SystemC clock with the Sparta Scheduler.  With this
  class, the modeler is not responsible for advancing time on the
  Sparta scheduler.  SystemC will be doing that via SC_THREADs.

  However, Sparta assume "control" of the scheduling in that the
  adapter by starting the SystemC scheduler (`sc_core::sc_start`) via
  the sparta::SysCSpartaSchedulerAdapter::run method.

  The expected development using this adapter is:

  -# Implement `sc_main` as normal
  -# Instantiate Sparta components including a sparta::Scheduler,
    sparta::ResourceTreeNode, etc
  -# Instantiate the sparta::SysCSpartaSchedulerAdapter passing to
    its constructor the sparta::Scheduler created
  -# Call `run()` on the adapter

  See an example of this in `sparta/test/SystemC_test.cpp`

  Caveats:

  -# Only one adapter is allowed in simulation
  -# Only one sparta::Scheduler is allowed in simulation
  -# Time bounces between SystemC advancement and Sparta.  Zero-timed
    communication between a SysC component and a Sparta component will
    not work.  This is due how the adapter operates.  Time is given to
    SystemC, which catches up to Sparta, then Sparta moves ahead (by
    at most 1 tick).  If a SystemC (or Sparta) component requests a
    send/immediate response to a component in the other modeling
    environment, there will always be a lag.  This is something that
    can be fixed, but there have been no use cases to date for this need
  -# Communication between a Sparta component (Sparta Port) and a
    SystemC Port (or TLM callback) requires a Sparta/SystemC gasket to
    be written by the modeler
