  The Sparta Scheduler can work in a SystemC environment using the
  sparta::SysCSpartaSchedulerAdapter.

  \section building_sysc Building

  To enable SystemC in Sparta, the cmake option COMPILE_WITH_SYSTEMC
  must be ON.  To run SystemC tests and the TLM examples, make sure
  Sparta's CMake build environment can find the SystemC package during
  configuration.  A message in the configuration output will be
  written if the package was found and COMPILE_WITH_SYSTEMC with set
  to ON:

  \code
  % cd sparta/build; cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCOMPILE_WITH_SYSTEMC=ON
  ...
  -- SystemC enabled: 2.3.3.20181013
  ...
  \endcode

  If not, then `cmake` could not find the SystemC package.  This can
  happen if there exists an install of SystemC elsewhere on the system
  (like a user's home directory).  Sparta can still use that install,
  but it must be built with the same C++ standard as Sparta (C++17 for
  example).  First, build SystemC:

  \code
  cd /path/to/systemc-2.3.3; mkdir build; cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  make install
  \endcode

  Then, configure/build Sparta again:

  -# Set your `SYSTEMC_HOME` environment variable to the SystemC build:
  `export SYSTEMC_HOME=/path/to/systemc-2.3.3`
  -# Re-configure Sparta: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCOMPILE_WITH_SYSTEMC=ON`

  The enablement message should print at this point.

  To build/run the SystemC example (example/SystemC), the TLM `example`
  directory must be found.  Since the TLM examples are not part of an
  install, the Sparta SystemC example CMakeLists.txt file will use the
  environment variable SYSTEMC_HOME to locate it.

  \section sysc_adapter SystemC/Sparta Adapter

  The sparta::SysCSpartaSchedulerAdapter is just that, an adapter
  that syncs the SystemC clock with the Sparta Scheduler.  With this
  class, the modeler is not responsible for advancing time on the
  Sparta scheduler.  SystemC will be doing that via SC_THREADs.

  However, Sparta assumes "control" of the scheduling in that the
  adapter by starting the SystemC scheduler (`sc_core::sc_start`) via
  the sparta::SysCSpartaSchedulerAdapter::run method.

  The expected development using this adapter is:

  -# Implement `sc_main` as normal
  -# Instantiate Sparta components including a sparta::Scheduler,
    sparta::ResourceTreeNode, etc
  -# Instantiate the sparta::SysCSpartaSchedulerAdapter passing to
    its constructor the sparta::Scheduler created
  -# Call `run()` on the adapter

  See an example of this in `sparta/test/SystemC_test.cpp`.

  There are 3 other examples of how Sparta can be used in a SystemC
  environment in the examples/SystemC directory:
  \code
     1_phase
     2_phase
     4_phase
  \endcode

  Each directory is an example of using the TLM initiator/target
  at_*_phase example swapping out the TLM target with a Sparta memory
  object and a Sparta/TLM socket adapter.

  Caveats on using the SystemC adapters:

  -# Only one adapter is allowed in simulation
  -# Only one sparta::Scheduler is allowed in simulation
  -# Time advancement bounces between SystemC and Sparta.  Zero-timed
     communication between a SysC component and a Sparta component may
     not work if the Sparta component requires advancement from the
     Sparta Scheduler.  This is currently untested.
  -# Communication between a Sparta component (Sparta Port) and a
    SystemC Port (or TLM callback) requires a Sparta/SystemC gasket to
    be written by the modeler
