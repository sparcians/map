# This extensions file is used together with another extensions
# file with the same tree node path in order to verify that we
# can have a merged ParameterTree like this:
#
#   top.cpu.core*.lsu.extension.foobar:
#     foo: 4
#     bar: 5
#   top.cpu.core0.lsu.extension.foobar:
#     foo: 8
#
# We verify that the final 'foo' value is 8, since core*
# is considered the "base" extension, while core0 is the
# "override" extension.

top.cpu.core*.lsu.extension.foobar:
  foo: 4
  bar: 5
