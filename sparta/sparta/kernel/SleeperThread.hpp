/**
 * \class SleeperThread
 * \brief A singleton class that when enabled, is responsible for asserting that the attached schedulers
 *        are progressing in tick time on a
 *        reasonable basis, and for checking whether we should time out of simulation.
 *
 * This class spawns a new thread at finalization time, and reaps
 * the thread at destruction.
 *
 * The class has pause() and unpause() methods that should be
 * called when the scheduler is not running, to avoid
 * assertions about scheduler progress when the scheduler is not
 * actually running!
 *
 *
 * <H2> Simulation timeout and Infinite Loop Protection </H2>
 *
 * The SleepThread is smart to try and detect infinite loops or no
 * activity during simulation. There is a background thread that wakes
 * up ever 30 seconds or so and asserts that simulation has advanced
 * in ticks. If the scheduler has not advanced in ticks, an exception
 * is thrown.
 *
 * For some cases, this special sleep thread should be turned off. If
 * simulation will not be advancing in ticks frequently or are doing
 * special debugging. To disable it,
 *
 * \code
 * // Disable infinite loop protection.
 * sparta::SleeperThread::getInstance()->disableInfiniteLoopProtection();
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note This should be called before the call to the scheduler's
 *       run() method. Though this will disable the thread at any
 *       time, even if called after run. The thread will be killed.
 *
 * There is also a command line option to disable it as well.
 * \code
 * --disable-infinite-loop-protection
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * \note Both turning off the sleeper thread and setting the sleep
 *       interval must be done before scheduler finalization.
 *
 * \note This class does introduce a new thread into the simulator. If you do not want this, explicity call SleeperThread::getInstance()->neverCreateAThread();
