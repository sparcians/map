     * allow persistent checkpoint files (saved between session) because the
     * data format subject to change and very sensitive to the exact device tree
     * configuration
     *
     * A checkpoint tree may look something like the following, where each
     * checkpoint is shown by its simulation tick number (not ID)
     * \verbatim
     * t=0 (head/snapshot) --> t=100 +-> t=300
     *                     |
