 * \brief Convenience macro for registering for a notification on a TreeNode
 * \param func Name of class member function that will be called when the
 * specified notification is posted. This function must have one of the
 * following signatures:
 * -# \code
 * ClassName::func( // TreeNode from which the notification originated
 *                  const TreeNode& origin_node,
 *                  // TreeNode at which the notifications was observed,
 *                  // causing this callback
 *                  const TreeNode& observation_node,
 *                  // Notification event data
 *                  const datat& data );
 * \endcode
 * -# \code
 * ClassName::func( // Notification event data
 *                  const datat& data );
 * \endcode
 * \param datat type of notification data for which this notification will
 * register. See sparta::TreeNode::registerForNotification for information on how
 * these types can be found in the tree.
 * \param name Name of the notification to register for. If "", will receive all
 * notifications from the subtree matching \a datat. See
 * sparta::TreeNode::registerForNotification for more details about the \a name
 * parameter.
 * \throw SpartaException if a registration is made on a datat/name combination
 * that cannot be posted by this the node's subtree (since there are no ancestor
 * NotificationSource nodes matching datat/name).
 * \note Deregister with DEREGISTER_FOR_NOTIFICATION. Failing to do so may cause
 * errors.
 *
 * This macro must be used within the class instance for which the callback
 * function is being registered. This macro uses the \a this pointer to
 * determine the observer class.
 *
 * This macro resolves to a function call to "registerForNotification" which is
 * should be used in a context such that it refers to
 * sparta::TreeNode::registerForNotification.
 *
 * Example
 * \code
 * MyClass::setup() {
 *   node->REGISTER_FOR_NOTIFICATION(handle_int1, int, "int_happened");
 *   node->REGISTER_FOR_NOTIFICATION(handle_int2, int, "int_happened");
 * }
 * MyClass::destroy() {
 *   node->DEREGISTER_FOR_NOTIFICATION(handle_int1, int, "int_happened");
 *   node->DEREGISTER_FOR_NOTIFICATION(handle_int2, int, "int_happened");
 * }
 * MyClass::handle_int1(const TreeNode& origin,
 *                      const TreeNode& observation_node,
 *                      const int& data) {
 *   (void) origin;
 *   (void) observation_node;
 *   (void) data;
 *   // ...

         * child of an existing tree node (if parent is not null).
         * \warning Subclasses should generally not use this constructor (or
         * should pass a null parent instead) because this constructor can
         * invoke addChild, which notifies observers that a child or parent is
         * being added. Observers of these notifications tend to require fully
         * constructed clases because they dynamically cast the TreeNode pointer
         * to the intended tree type to find out its actual type. Then, it may
         * examine the fields of the TreeNode subclass which may not yet be
         * fully populated.
         *
         * \param parent TreeNode to which this will be added as a child. If
         * this constructor is being invoked by a subclass, parent must be
         * nullptr (or use a constructor with no parent argument). Subclass
         * constructor is then responsible for adding the node.
         * \param name Name of this node. Name must satisfy validateName. May be
         * NODE_NAME_NONE to indicate anonymous node. A group and group index is
         * required for anonymous nodes. name must not be the same as any alias
         * or name of another child of \a parent. It is HIGHLY recommended that
         * name end in a number if there are multiple instances of similar
         * objects at the same level in the tree (e.g. core0, core1). Even if
         * only one such object exists at some level in the tree, having a
         * numeric suffix now will ensure it is easy to adapt Python scripts to
         * handle muliple instanecs later.
         * \param group Group name of this node. Must satisfy validateGroup. May
         * be GROUP_NAME_NONE if a valid node name is given and group_idx ==
         * GROUP_IDX_NONE.
         * \param group_idx Group index within \a group. Must satisfy
         * validateGroup. Must be GROUP_IDX_NONE unless group !=
         * GROUP_NAME_NONE.
         * \param desc Description of this TreeNode. Must satisfy validateDesc
         * \param is_indexable Is this node indexable by its parent such that
         * it can be accessed by group and index. Set this to false if
         * children will have colliding group numbers and indexes (e.g. a banked
         * register set). In almost all cases, this should be true.
         * \note TreeNode construction is NOT thread safe

         * In a Python shell atop sparta, \a might allow the following means of
         * accessing foo:
         * \verbatim
         * >>> parent.foo
         * <Group of 2 Nodes>
         * >>> parent.foo2 # Node name

          privacy_level_ is used to implement a tighter scoping of which parts of the tree are accessible to others.
          This can be used to prevent sub-components leaking implementation to other components that should only know
          about the parent component, and not necessarily their children.

          The privacy_level_ ONLY affects calls to getChildren/findChildren/etc on parent nodes.
          The relationship that matters is whether or not the privacy_level_ of the child is the same as the parent.
          The value of privacy_level_ only has any meaning up and down the subtree,
          side to side on the tree (siblings) privacy levels can be completely different values etc.
          The idea is when recursing down the tree, you cant recurse to a child node that
          is more private than the current node.

          Doing it this way allows for subtrees that are more and more private.
               A(0)

           |          |
         F(2)       G(2)

         In this example "A" can be used to get to C,
         but NOT B. A handle on B can be used to get to D,
         but not F. The fact that F and G both have a privacy level of 2
         has no meaning other than their privacy levels are greater than their respective parents.

         A notification from F cannot be been from B in this since registration for callbacks relies
         on getChildren to find the notification source. This is the main desire.

         This value is set when using addChildPrivate.
