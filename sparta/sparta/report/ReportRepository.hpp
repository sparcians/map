 * \file ReportRepository.hpp
 *
 * \brief Each simulation may have up to one report repository. Reports are
 * organized into directories, where all reports in the same directory have
 * the exact same:
 *
 *      Definition file         (.yaml)
 *      Destination file        (.txt, .html, ...)
 *      Location pattern        ("_global", "top.core1", ...)
 *      Format                  (optional)
 *
 *      Report start time               (optional expression)
 *      Report stop time                (optional expression)
 *      Report update period            (optional expression)
 *
 * All of this information, optional or not, is in the app::ReportDescriptor
 * class. So in order to checkout a new directory, you must hand over a
 * ReportDescriptor object to the repository. The returned directory handle
 * can be used with other repository methods to add reports, commit them, etc.
 *
 * Any resources needing to be instantiated (such as triggers) will only occur
 * when you commit a directory to the repository.
 *
 * The ReportDescriptor you give the repository when you check out a new directory
 * must have ZERO report instantiations already in it.
 *
 * There is an API that lets you take back all committed reports for any reason at any
 * time, even during simulation. See "ReportRepository::saveReports()" below.
 *
 * However, note that there is no real reason you *must* release the reports. They
 * will start, update, and stop on their own according to the directory configuration
 * (from each directory's app::ReportDescriptor), and will automatically be saved to file
 * at the end of simulation. Releasing reports could be used during exception handling,
 * post-processing, etc. but most of the time, you should not need to release them at all.
