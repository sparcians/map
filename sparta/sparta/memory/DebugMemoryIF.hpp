         * \brief Memory interface which represents a simple, immediately
         * accessible (blocking) address-space with support for peek and poke
         * acceeses having no side effects other than changing the desired
         * memory.
         *
         * This interface does not support non-blocking accesses or access
         * attributes.
         *
         * This interface operates on post-translated addresses from
         * the TranslationIF available through getTranslationIF
         *
         * The object implementing this interface can perform any translation
         * or logic to satisfy memory accesses.
         *
         * Peek and Poke accesses within this interface are automatically
         * chunked into block-constrained accesses and re-assembled.
         *
         * This class is intended to be an innocuous interface to some kind of
         * "memory" from the perspective of some simulation unit with which this
         * interface is associated. For example, if attached to a core this
         * interface would most appropriately present the software view of
         * virtual memory. Note that data and instruction memory views from a
         * core may need to use different debugging interfaces. It is possible
         * different interfaces could even be provided for each address-space
         * avaialable per data and instruction depending on that core's mmu.
         *
         * Example
         * \code
         * using sparta::memory;
         * // DebugMemoryIF* dbgmi;
         * // addr_t varrd;
         * // const uint8_t data[4];
         * // uint8_t buf[4];
         * addr_t paddr = dbgmi->getTranslationIF()->translate(vaddr);
         * dbgmi->poke(paddr, 4, data);
         * dbgmi->peek(paddr, 4, buf);
         * // Note: Translation is only required if the interface does not
         * // represent direct access to physical memory
         * \endcode
