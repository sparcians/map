     * SchedulingPhase are phases within the SPARTA framework that
     * allow a user to "categorize" events, ports, collection, and
     * updatables into groups for auto-precedence establishment.
     *
     * The current organization of this framework is UPCaT
     * (Updateables, Ports, Collection, and Tick [incl PostTick]) or more specifically:
     *
     * -# Updatables are ordered first (sparta::SchedulingPhase::Update)
     * -# Ports, N-Cycle where N > 0, that transfer/append to
     *    resources (like pipes, buffers) are updated
     *    next (specifically, registered handlers are called) (sparta::SchedulingPhase::PortUpdate)
     * -# Collection for pipeline viewing (sparta::SchedulingPhase::Collection)
     * -# Tickables, or simulation components that operate on data
     *    from updatables and ports. (sparta::SchedulingPhase::Tick)
     * -# Post-tickables, or events fired after all Tick events (sparta::SchedulingPhase::PostTick)
     *
     * What happens in the framework is that all Scheduleable objects
     * that are in the SchedulingPhase::Update phase will be organized
     * on the Scheduler before SchedulingPhase::PortUpdate
     * Scheduleable events, which are before
     * SchedulingPhase::Collection Scheduleable objects, and so on.
     * Within a specific phase, a modeler can order events as well.
     * For example, two events in the SchedulingPhase::Tick can be
     * ordered using the ">>" operator.  See Precedence.h for more
     * information.
     *
     * For 0-cycle Ports, SchedulingPhase::PortUpdate events occur in
     * the SchedulingPhase::Tick scheduling phase and are ordered with
     * other events also in the SchedulingPhase::Tick scheduling
     * phase.  This only happens, however, when precedence is
     * established between the Port and that subsequent events.  This
     * precedence is established by calling
     * Port::registerConsumerEvent or Port::registerProducingEvent
     * (depending on the sparta::Port::Direction).
