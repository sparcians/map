     * \class Port
     * \brief The port interface used to bind port types together and
     *        defines a port behavior
     *
     * Ports are the glue that connect one component in simulation
     * with another.  Port do NOT exchange interfaces between
     * components, but instead allow data to be exchanged between
     * components.  Data is exchanged at the derivative level,
     * specifically with DataInPort/OutPort,
     * SignalInPort/SignalOutPort, and SyncInPort/SyncOutPort.
     *
     * The Port class is a TreeNode, meaning that it has placement
     * within a simulation Tree, specically within a sparta::PortSet.
     * Typically, this node will be called "ports" and can be found
     * via a tree walk.  For example, if a resource "blockA" has a
     * Port called "mysignal_in", it can found in the heirarchy:
     * 'top.blockA.ports.mysignal_in'.
     *
     * As for precedence, producers registered on OutPorts will always
     * precede Consumers registered on InPorts within the same
     * sparta::SchedulingPhase
     *
