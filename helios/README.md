# Helios Visulation Tools

This part of the MAP repo contains two tools that work with
Sparta-developed models to visualize the data generated.

1. Plato -- (WIP) A web-based visualization tool that will consume
   database files generated by Sparta-based models and allow the user
   to "drag-n-drop" plots onto a main canvas
1. pipeViewer (a.k.a Argos) -- A pipeline crawler, consistent with the
   concept of a waveform viewer, but with more information viewable.
   It's sometimes been called a rainbox chart or waterfall diagram.
