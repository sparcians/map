(probably stale) notes on requirements for heatmap tool which are not in the current plato


 - Some way to annotate things with text?

 - From Brad:
 	- New widget for "history correlation"
 		- Will need to store history bits!
 	- FFT on branch history correlation? Need to flesh out details

 - Read shp geometry from trace file!
 - Time series plot of num training events
 - should be able to generate the individual plots we have in bp tool easily in jupyter

 - High-density branch-trace view (take branch trace and plot as a timeline heatmap)

 - Email chain about brad's concrete example w/ 
  	- trc060/328/Geekbench.v5.drop12.clang7.0.2.aarch64.20190109.220_TextRender.stf.xz

 - Filtere timeseries plots
	 - Filtered plot of training event frequency (compare vs mispredict)
	 - Filtered plot of mispredict rate (per brach)
	 - Plot of mispredict rate with a series for EACH BRANCH!

 - Time Range improvements
 	- TextBoxes for from, to, range
 	- Dropdown for selecting ticks, cyclcles (and clock), or branch index, or abitrary
 		- Implies data sources need to clearly define these "time" units for translation

 - Widgets have notion of time and 'fixed' time. So same widget can view two areas of the results at the same time with the same "view" settings

 - Fuzhou's LHP classification and analysis tool
 	- Replicate or integrate?
 	- Key points
 		- Characterize LHP patterns into succinct information when looking at a branch
 		- Show "predictable or not"

 - Selecting ROW cell from branch trace table and seeing all weights that contributed to it in the selected range
 	- display these in tracked cells?
 
 - Notion of more than one loaded data set for comparison
 	- Side-by side views?
 	- names for each
 	- not limited to just 2 or 3 - any number
 	- efficient side-by-side viewers or cluster heatmaps maybe
 	- global controls (or at least global synchronization)
 	- auto-correlation features
 	- "diff" heatmap showing comparison or some other arithmetic

 - Brad's topoology viewer idea
 	- requires ghist/phist
 	- requires knowing hash of gist/phist
 	- maybe use Eval

 - What-if features
 	- (PROBABLY NOT PRACTICAL)
 	- store ghist/phist
 		- or ability to generate them on the fly
 	- manipulate hashes?
 	- this is basically re-running the experiment though since weight tables will need to be updated from the start

 - Display geometry must come from the trace file
    - e.g. num rows, num tables, num banks, etc.

 - Disasm viewer (show opcode and mnemonic)
    - applies to profile and trace views

 - Code context profile view
 	- Summary stats for branches in a source code viewer
 		- both C code (if available) and assembly
 		- if no C code, at least some function/call-stack annotations

 - Call stack view
    - Load up elf on server-side and determine callstack from branch trace
    	- may require simulator to provide this

 - Tool should be a base for arbitrary stats views as well
    - time-series selection and resizing (a la Grafana)
    - custom widgets: some specific, others general.
    - layout w/ docking using ?
    	- https://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-documentation/documentation/jqxdocking/jquery-docking-getting-started.htm?search=

 - Client-Server architecture
 	- Data loading and heavy computation on server
 	- Some rendering on server, some on client.

 - Arbitarary strings to combine saved data into metrics/stats
 	- E.g. num weights correct divided by num weights incorrect

 - Collapsible panels

 - Rearrangable panels (to an extent)
  	- Possibly a div-based flow

 - tooltips on all controls

 - Linkage of some plots to others
 	- there may be some "eagle's view" plots while others in "groups" should all zoom in together
 	- zooming in on one plot should affect some others in the same "group"

 - Simple writer code block that can be integrated into any project with ease

 - Workspace concept
    - Saving views and configuration for later use and sharing
    - Cloning of workspaces for modification
 	- Ability to mark interesting ranges of time on the timeline for later viewing

 - Flame graphs or some other kind of navigable code context view below timeline charts

 - Could reimplement pipeViewer in this tool?

 - Datasources?
  	- time series
  	- branch traces
  	- elf files 
  	- study results
  	- bt9?
  	- pipeViewer transactiondb?
